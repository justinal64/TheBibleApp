#Front End Capstone(TheBibleApp)



## Description
In this project I created a website for reading the Bible to children. The child can click a button to have the Bible read outload or they can touch the images and they will rotate using ng-animate. The user can also visit an adult version of the website and read the King James version of the bible.


## How to run
In your terminal run the following commands:
<br />
Navigate to the lib folder in your terminal and type:
```
npm install
```
This will install all of the dependencies for the project.
<br />
Next type the following:
```
cd ..
```
This will move you back to the root folder of the project.
<br />
Next type the following:
```
http-server -p 9999
```
Then navigate to [http://localhost:9999](http://localhost:9999) in your browser to view the output.

You can also use firebase to register/login. Once you login the Children's Bible will keep up with the last place you read the Bible when you come back.
